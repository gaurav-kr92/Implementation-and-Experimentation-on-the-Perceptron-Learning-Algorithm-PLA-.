# Implementation-and-Experimentation-on-the-Perceptron-Learning-Algorithm-PLA. 

Problem Statement:
Given a dataset where items belong to either of the two classes [Positive (+1) and Negative
(-1)], train and validate a machine learning model based on the Perceptron Learning
Algorithm. The datasets may or may not be linearly separable and that may affect the
training process.

The implementation contain: 
1. Implementation of the basic PLA.
2. Implementation of K-fold cross validation
3. Implementation of the performance measures: Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1
